                You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel — a hunger and thirst. For six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a whirlpool, swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts leading nowhere, spinning round swift and steady.

            I’m an only child who thrives on solitude.</br></br>
            As I get older, carving out moments to myself have 
            been a challenge: there are dishes that require 
            washing, laundry that requires folding, errands that 
            require running.</br></br>
            It’s easy to get bogged down by the mundane, but 
            should we undergo these actions for too long without 
            balancing them with activities that foster calmness 
            and strengthen our inner resolve, we’ll end up bitter, 
            irritable, and disconnected from the present.</br></br>
            Below are 5 activities that help me reset, and I commit 
            to doing at least one each day. It doesn’t matter what 
            time during the day or for how long (although 45–60 
            minutes is ideal), so long as it’s done. Whether I’m 
            having a pleasant or a trying day matters none.</br></br>
            <strong>Walking.</strong> While taking care of a dog 
            may be viewed as burdensome, I revel in the fact that 
            part of my responsibilities involve spending time 
            outdoors with my pupper. We’re fortunate to live 
            near two parks and a beautiful 9 km trail of green 
            space for walkers, runners, and cyclists, all of which 
            serve as an escape from the noisy concrete jungle of 
            Toronto. Not only does my body crave a nice walk after 
            spending at least eight hours sitting in front of a 
            computer screen, but research shows that going for 
            walks specifically <em>in nature</em> boots attention and 
            rejuvenates the brain. Depending on the weather and 
            dinner plans, I either take my dog for a prolonged 
            walk as soon as I return from work or after our 
            dinners. Put down the remote control, get up off the 
            couch, and go for an evening walk instead.</br></br>
            <strong>Running.</strong> Although there is an 
            infinite number of ways that one can exercise, I am 
            partial to running. Plain and simple, I enjoy the 
            flexibility that running brings, how little is 
            required in order to be a runner, and the fact that 
            I don’t need a teammate. For me, all I need is music, 
            headphones, and a pair of running shoes. That’s it. 
            That’s all. I have run in the morning. I have run 
            late at night. I have gone for a run in the freezing 
            cold and when the sun has been blazing hot. The only 
            competition you face is your limits. How far are you 
            able to run? How long are you able to keep the pace? 
            Are you able to meet your running goal despite the 
            difficult weather? It’s only you and perfect solitude.</br></br>
            <strong>Reading.</strong> I have been a long-time 
            supporter of reading for 30 minutes before heading to 
            bed, but recently I’ve been experimenting with reading 
            as soon as I wake up. I make a fresh cup of coffee in 
            my french press, let out my dog while it steeps, and 
            then pour my first cup and sit down with a book. I’ve 
            noticed that reading in the morning facilitates a 
            calmness that continues as I head into the office at 
            8:30 a.m. There’s also something to be said of doing 
            something that doesn’t involve staring at a screen 
            when we first wake up.</br></br>
            <strong>Listening.</strong> I’m not ashamed to admit 
            that I have a finite amount of motivation. Although 
            80% of the work I do is meaningful, there are still 
            days where I drag my feet. For this, I use audiobooks 
            and podcasts. I even have a selection of favourite 
            podcast episodes that I listen to that gives me an 
            extra mood boost. During the day, especially on my 
            commute to and from work, listening to people much 
            wiser than me does the trick.</br></br>
            <strong>Eating.</strong> When was the last time that 
            you took yourself out to dinner? It’s been a few months 
            for me. I remember it clearly: My partner was away and 
            I had nowhere to be after work. I decided, on a whim, 
            to visit a new public library that was a few subway 
            stops away from my apartment. I meandered through the 
            aisles and found two books that I had been meaning to 
            read. Instead of taking the subway, I decided to take 
            the long way home and walk outside. On my way, I paused 
            in front of my favourite sushi joint in the 
            neighbourhood and impulsively decided to eat dinner 
            there. At a table for one, I sat, ate, and read. Nowhere 
            to be. Nothing to attend to. All it took was 2 hours 
            alone, $15.00, and a library book to feel renewed.</br></br>
            Taking the time to reset every day isn’t selfish, it’s 
            a matter of self-sufficiency. To be able to develop 
            resiliency, fortitude, and endurance for life’s unending 
            challenges. To neither burn out or fade away. To welcome 
            each day with energy and enthusiasm. To ensure that we 
            are living up to our potential.</br></br>
            Life is a marathon not a sprint. Commit to its longevity.
