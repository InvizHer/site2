                You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel — a hunger and thirst. For six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a whirlpool, swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts leading nowhere, spinning round swift and steady.

            I’m an only child who thrives on solitude.</br></br>
            As I get older, carving out moments to myself have been a challenge: there are dishes that require washing, laundry that requires folding, errands that require running.</br></br>
            It’s easy to get bogged down by the mundane, but should we undergo these actions for too long without balancing them with activities that foster calmness and strengthen our inner resolve, we’ll end up bitter, irritable, and disconnected from the present.</br></br>
